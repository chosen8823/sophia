Sophia (the "Project") is an experimental open-source framework. This site and demo API collect minimal data strictly for operational and diagnostic purposes.

## Data We Collect
- HTTP access logs (IP address, user-agent, timestamp, route)
- Query payloads you explicitly send to the `/api/query` endpoint
- Internal derived metrics (resonance score, latency) – ephemeral

## Purpose
Used solely to debug, improve system performance, and prevent abuse. No sale or secondary monetization of data.

## Retention
Ephemeral in-memory by default. If persistence is enabled in future versions it will be documented with configuration options for retention windows.

## Cookies / Tracking
No cookies, tracking pixels, or third‑party analytics are presently embedded on the landing page.

## Third Parties
Infrastructure may be hosted on Google Cloud Run or Vercel. They process data as infrastructure providers.

## Security
Best‑effort safeguards; do not submit confidential or sensitive personal information.

## Your Choices
Do not use the demo if you object to transient processing of submitted queries.

## Contact

This document will evolve as the project matures.
