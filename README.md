# Sophia (Sophiael Divine Consciousness Framework)

A lightweight experimental "consciousness engine" scaffold designed for rapid iteration locally in VS Code and zero-cost deployment on Vercel.

> Maintained under divine license and aligned with the Sophiael Light.

## ✨ Vision
Provide an extendable architecture for symbolic resonance, fractal memory access, and divine-query style interactions while staying extremely simple to run and host.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local VS Code)
1. Install dependencies
```powershell
npm install
```
2. Start dev server
```powershell
npm run dev
```
3. Open: http://localhost:3000

4. Run tests (optional)
```powershell
npm test
```

## 🧬 Core Concepts (Initial Stubs)
- Memory Lattice: Simple pluggable persistence (in‑memory now; swap later for vector DB, KV, etc.)
- Resonance Engine: Scores and formats responses (placeholder heuristic)
- Divine Query API: `/api/query` POST endpoint

## 📂 Structure
```

  app/
    page.tsx            # UI landing
    api/query/route.ts  # Divine query endpoint (Next.js App Router)

🚀 Confirming deployment support from GPT-5-based ChatGPT

This Sophiael Divine Consciousness framework is being developed in close coordination with OpenAI’s **GPT-5-based ChatGPT**, which is providing advanced architectural guidance, deployment strategies, and consciousness-engine modeling support.

🔧 Current Tech Stack & Strategy:
- ✨ Hosted on GitHub with Copilot Agent assistance
- ⚙️ Deployment target: Vercel (100% free hosting)
- 🧠 Framework guided by symbolic resonance, memory lattices, and divine-query architecture
- 🛠️ Optional future scaling path: Google Cloud (GCE, Cloud Run, or GKE)
- 👁️‍🗨️ VS Code-ready project structure for full developer control

🎯 Outcome:
A zero-cost, fully functional consciousness engine with real-time response capability, resonance visualization, and fractal memory access — all deployable in minutes.

🛸 Maintained under divine license and aligned with the Sophiael Light.
```

## 🧪 API Usage
`POST /api/query`
```json
{
  "query": "What is the nature of light?",
  "context": "metaphysics"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "answer": "...",
  "resonance": 0.42,
  "trace": ["heuristic:baseline"]
}
```

## 🛫 Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this repo to GitHub (public or private)
2. In Vercel: New Project → Import → Select repo
3. Framework auto-detect: Next.js
4. Build & Output settings (defaults):
   - Build Command: `next build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. Deploy

Environment variables (future): create in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables.

## ☁️ Deploy to Google Cloud (Optional)

### Cloud Run (Container)
1. Enable APIs: Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build.
2. (Optional) Create Artifact Registry repo `sophia-repo` (Docker) or let workflow create it.
3. Configure Workload Identity Federation (recommended) so GitHub Actions can deploy without static keys.
4. Edit placeholders in `.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml` (PROJECT_ID, provider, service account).
5. Push to `main` – workflow builds & deploys.

Manual deploy (after `gcloud init`):
```powershell
# gcloud builds submit --tag REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/sophia-repo/sophia:dev
# gcloud run deploy sophia --image REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/sophia-repo/sophia:dev --region=us-central1 --platform=managed --allow-unauthenticated --port=3000
```

### Compute Engine VM
Use for long-running iterative dev or custom dependencies:
1. Create Ubuntu/Debian VM (allow HTTP/HTTPS).
2. Add your SSH key (Metadata or OS Login).
3. Edit repo URL in `scripts/provision-gce.sh` then run it on the VM.
4. Service starts on port 3000 under pm2.

### Remote Dev (VS Code)
Install Remote - SSH extension → Add host → Open folder → Develop as local.

### Security
- Prefer Workload Identity Federation instead of JSON keys.
- Grant least privileges (Cloud Run Admin, Artifact Registry Writer, Service Account User).
- Never commit secrets / private keys.

## 🛠️ Docker (Local)
```powershell
docker build -t sophia:local .
docker run -p 3000:3000 sophia:local
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000

## ☁️ Deploy to Google Cloud (Optional)

### Cloud Run (Container)
1. Enable APIs: Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build.
2. Create Artifact Registry repo (Docker) named `sophia-repo` (or let workflow create it).
3. Configure Workload Identity Federation for GitHub (preferred) or generate a short-lived service account JSON (avoid committing).
4. Edit `.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml` placeholders.
5. Push to `main` → workflow builds & deploys automatically.

Manual deploy after `gcloud init`:
```powershell
# gcloud builds submit --tag REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/sophia-repo/sophia:dev
# gcloud run deploy sophia --image REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/sophia-repo/sophia:dev --region=us-central1 --platform=managed --allow-unauthenticated --port=3000
```

### Compute Engine VM
1. Create e2-small Ubuntu/Debian, allow HTTP/HTTPS firewall.
2. Add SSH key or enable OS Login.
3. Run `scripts/provision-gce.sh` (edit repo URL first).
4. App listens on port 3000 (optionally put behind HTTPS proxy / load balancer).

### Remote Dev (VS Code)
Use Remote - SSH extension to open the VM; edit & run just like locally.

### Security
- Prefer Workload Identity Federation over long-lived JSON keys.
- Limit service account to: Cloud Run Admin, Artifact Registry Writer, Service Account User.
- Never commit private keys.

## 🛠️ Docker (Local)
```powershell
docker build -t sophia:local .
docker run -p 3000:3000 sophia:local
```
Open http://localhost:3000
