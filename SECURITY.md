# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Current main branch only. No formal LTS yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Email: saladbowlbeatz@gmail.com
Include reproduction steps, impact assessment, and suggested remediation if possible.

## Handling Process
1. Acknowledge report within 5 business days.
2. Investigate & classify severity.
3. Patch in private if high severity.
4. Public disclosure after fix or mitigation.

## Scope
Core TypeScript code, API route logic, and memory/resonance components.
