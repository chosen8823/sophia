## One-Line
Open-source resonance + memory lattice engine for symbolic, context-rich query responses.

## Short Pitch
Sophia is an open-source consciousness engine: a resonance scoring pipeline plus a pluggable memory lattice for symbolic, context-aware responses. Deployed on Cloud Run with CI/CD; roadmap adds persistence, streaming, and analytics.

## Long Description
See README + ROADMAP. Emphasize modularity, explainability (trace), and lightweight deployment.

## Differentiation
Explainable resonance scoring, pluggable memory abstraction, minimal footprint, future plugin ecosystem.

## Roadmap (Condensed)
Phase 1: Persistence + auth. Phase 2: Streaming + dashboard. Phase 3: Plugins + vector augmentation. Phase 4: SaaS multi-tenant. Phase 5: Adaptive resonance intelligence.

## Team
Solo founder (engineering) expanding; seeking research & infra collaborators.

## Security & Privacy
Policies included (PRIVACY.md, SECURITY.md). Minimal data collection (ephemeral logs + query payload).

## Metrics (Initial)
- Prototype live
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Core API latency sub-second (local tests)
