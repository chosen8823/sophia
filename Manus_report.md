## TLDR: Manus AI Agent Report

Manus is an autonomous AI agent built as a wrapper around foundation models (primarily Claude 3.5/3.7 and Alibaba's Qwen). It operates in a cloud-based virtual computing environment with full access to tools like web browsers, shell commands, and code execution. The system's key innovation is using executable Python code as its action mechanism ("CodeAct" approach), allowing it to perform complex operations autonomously.
The architecture consists of an iterative agent loop (analyze → plan → execute → observe), with specialized modules for planning, knowledge retrieval, and memory management. Manus uses file-based memory to track progress and store information across operations. The system can be replicated using open-source components including CodeActAgent (a fine-tuned Mistral model), Docker for sandboxing, Playwright for web interaction, and LangChain for orchestration. While replication is technically feasible, achieving Manus's reliability and performance will require careful prompt engineering and extensive testing.





# Manus Autonomous AI Agent: Technical Analysis

## 1. System Architecture Analysis

**Foundation Model Backbone:** Manus is built on top of powerful foundation language models rather than a proprietary model from scratch. The team’s chief scientist revealed that Manus initially leveraged Anthropic’s **Claude** (specifically *Claude 3.5* “Sonnet v1”) as the core reasoning engine, supplemented by fine-tuned versions of Alibaba’s **Qwen** large model ([Manus背后的基础大模型首次公布！基于美国Claude和阿里Qwen开发|美国|阿里|AI_新浪科技_新浪网](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/roll/2025-03-11/doc-inepfzst2804657.shtml#:~:text=3%E6%9C%8810%E6%97%A5%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8CMonica%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E5%88%9B%E5%A7%8B%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%81%E9%A6%96%E5%B8%AD%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E5%AE%B6%E5%AD%A3%E9%80%B8%E8%B6%85%EF%BC%88Peak%EF%BC%89%E4%BB%8A%E6%97%A5%E5%9C%A8%E7%A4%BE%E4%BA%A4%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E9%80%8F%E9%9C%B2%EF%BC%8CManus%20%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%86%20Claude%20%E5%A4%A7%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%8D%E5%90%8C%E7%9A%84%20%E9%98%BF%E9%87%8C%E5%8D%83%E9%97%AE%E5%A4%A7%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%88Qwen%EF%BC%89%E7%9A%84%E5%BE%AE%E8%B0%83%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E3%80%82)). In other words, Manus’s “brain” is a combination of existing LLMs. They have been actively upgrading this backbone – for example, testing *Claude 3.7* internally for future use ([Manus背后的基础大模型首次公布！基于美国Claude和阿里Qwen开发|美国|阿里|AI_新浪科技_新浪网](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/roll/2025-03-11/doc-inepfzst2804657.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E5%BD%93%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%20Manus%20%E6%97%B6%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AA%E6%8B%BF%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%20Claude%203,7%E7%9C%8B%E8%B5%B7%E6%9D%A5%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%BE%88%E6%9C%89%E5%89%8D%E9%80%94%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E6%AD%A3%E5%9C%A8%E5%86%85%E9%83%A8%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E4%BC%9A%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). Reports indicate Manus can even invoke multiple models dynamically for different sub-tasks (“multi-model dynamic invocation”), using each model’s strengths – e.g. using *Claude 3* for complex logical reasoning, *GPT-4* for coding tasks, and Google’s *Gemini* for broad knowledge queries ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E6%93%9A%E3%80%8ATechChurch%E3%80%8B%E5%A0%B1%E5%B0%8E%EF%BC%8CManus%E7%9A%84%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC%E4%B8%A6%E9%9D%9E%E5%BE%9E%E9%9B%B6%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E7%B5%90%E5%90%88%E7%8F%BE%E6%9C%89%E5%92%8C%E7%B6%93%E9%81%8E%E5%BE%AE%E8%AA%BF%E7%9A%84AI%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E3%80%82%E5%85%B6%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC%E5%9C%98%E9%9A%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%8CMan%20us%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%86%E3%80%8C%E5%A4%9A%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E8%AA%BF%E7%94%A8%E3%80%8D%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%EF%BC%8C%E8%AA%BF%E7%94%A8%E5%A4%9A%E5%80%8B%E7%8F%BE%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%9E%8B%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%88%E5%A6%82%20GPT,4%20%E7%94%A8%E6%96%BC%E7%B7%A8%E7%A2%BC%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%20Gemini%E5%89%87%E7%94%A8%E6%96%BC%E7%B6%9C%E5%90%88%E7%9F%A5%E8%AD%98%E8%99%95%E7%90%86%E3%80%82)). (It’s unclear if GPT-4/Gemini were actually in use or planned, but this was suggested in media ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E6%93%9A%E3%80%8ATechChurch%E3%80%8B%E5%A0%B1%E5%B0%8E%EF%BC%8CManus%E7%9A%84%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC%E4%B8%A6%E9%9D%9E%E5%BE%9E%E9%9B%B6%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E7%B5%90%E5%90%88%E7%8F%BE%E6%9C%89%E5%92%8C%E7%B6%93%E9%81%8E%E5%BE%AE%E8%AA%BF%E7%9A%84AI%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E3%80%82%E5%85%B6%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC%E5%9C%98%E9%9A%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%8CMan%20us%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%86%E3%80%8C%E5%A4%9A%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E8%AA%BF%E7%94%A8%E3%80%8D%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%EF%BC%8C%E8%AA%BF%E7%94%A8%E5%A4%9A%E5%80%8B%E7%8F%BE%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%9E%8B%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%88%E5%A6%82%20GPT,4%20%E7%94%A8%E6%96%BC%E7%B7%A8%E7%A2%BC%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%20Gemini%E5%89%87%E7%94%A8%E6%96%BC%E7%B6%9C%E5%90%88%E7%9F%A5%E8%AD%98%E8%99%95%E7%90%86%E3%80%82)).) The key point is that Manus acts as an orchestrator over top-tier LLMs, rather than a single standalone model – a design that allows it to exploit the best available AI capabilities for each task.

**Cloud Agent with Tool Sandbox:** Unlike a typical chatbot confined to text, Manus runs within a **virtual computing environment** in the cloud. This environment is a full Ubuntu Linux workspace with internet access ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Csandbox_environment%3E%20System%20Environment%3A%20,Home%20directory%3A%20%2Fhome%2Fubuntu)), where Manus can use a suite of tools and software as if it were a human power-user. According to the system specifications, Manus has access to a **shell** (with sudo privileges), a **web browser** it can control, a **file system**, and interpreters for programming languages like Python and Node.js ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=,applications%20and%20provide%20public%20access)) ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Cdeploy_rules%3E%20,and%20emphasize%20their%20temporary%20nature)). It can even launch web servers and expose them to the internet. All of this happens server-side – Manus continues working even if the user’s device is off, which distinguishes it from agents that run in a user’s browser (for example, OpenAI’s experimental “Operator”) ([After DeepSeek, China takes a leap with Manus, world’s first autonomous AI agent — TFN](https://techfundingnews.com/after-deepseek-china-takes-a-leap-with-manus-worlds-first-autonomous-ai-agent/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Manus%20operates%20in%20a,and%20even%20troubleshoots%20technical%20issues)) ([After DeepSeek, China takes a leap with Manus, world’s first autonomous AI agent — TFN](https://techfundingnews.com/after-deepseek-china-takes-a-leap-with-manus-worlds-first-autonomous-ai-agent/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Manus%20operates%20in%20a,sustaining%20digital%20worker)). The sandboxed tool environment means Manus isn’t limited to replying in natural language; it can **act**: e.g. browse websites, fill forms, write and execute code, or call APIs autonomously. This architecture turns Manus into something like a **digital worker** in the cloud, not just a conversational bot.

**Agent Loop and Orchestration:** Manus operates through an iterative **agent loop** that structures its autonomy ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=,per%20iteration%2C%20patiently%20repeat%20above)). At a high level, each cycle of the loop consists of: (1) **Analyzing** the current state and user request (from an event stream of recent interactions), (2) **Planning/Selecting an action** (deciding which tool or operation to use next), (3) **Executing** that action in the sandbox, and (4) **Observing** the result, which gets appended to the event stream ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=1,user%20via%20message%20tools%2C%20providing)). This loop repeats until Manus determines the task is complete, at which point it will output the final result to the user and enter an idle state ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=environment%20with%20new%20observations%20added,agent_loop)). The design explicitly limits the agent to one tool action per iteration – it must await the result of each action before deciding the next step ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=1,above%20steps%20until%20task%20completion)). This control flow prevents the model from running away with a long sequence of unchecked operations and allows the system (and user) to monitor each step. 

**Planner Module (Task Decomposition):** To manage complex tasks, Manus incorporates a **Planner module** that breaks high-level objectives into an ordered list of steps ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Cplanner_module%3E%20,step%20number%2C%20status%2C%20and%20reflection)). When the user gives a goal or project, the Planner generates a plan in a kind of pseudocode or enumerated list (with step numbers, descriptions, and status) which is injected into the Manus agent’s context as a special “Plan” event. For example, if asked to build a data visualization, the planner might produce a sequence: *1. Gather data, 2. Clean data, 3. Generate plot, 4. Save and send plot*. Manus uses this as a roadmap, executing each step in order. The plan can be updated on the fly if the task changes ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=,step%20number%2C%20status%2C%20and%20reflection)). The agent refers to the plan each iteration and knows it must complete all steps to finish the task ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=,step%20number%2C%20status%2C%20and%20reflection)). This mechanism gives Manus a form of **lookahead and structured decision-making** rather than just reacting turn by turn. It’s similar in spirit to how AutoGPT or BabyAGI maintain a task list for an objective, ensuring the AI doesn’t forget the overarching goal while doing minute actions.

**Knowledge and Data Modules:** Manus doesn’t rely solely on the LLM’s built-in knowledge. It has a **Knowledge module** that provides relevant reference information or best-practice guidelines from a knowledge base when needed ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Cknowledge_module%3E%20,knowledge_module)). These appear as “Knowledge” events in the context, giving the agent helpful info specific to the domain or task (for instance, if the task is to write an essay, the knowledge module might supply a style guide or factual snippets to use). In parallel, Manus can use a **Datasource module** for factual data via APIs ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Cdatasource_module%3E%20,system%2C%20no%20login%20or%20authorization)). The agent is given a library of pre-approved **data APIs** (for weather, finance, etc., presumably) along with their documentation. When those are relevant, it will call them through Python code rather than scraping the web, since the system prioritizes authoritative data sources over general web info ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%3Cinfo_rules%3E%20,validation)). For example, Manus could call a Weather API to get up-to-date climate data (as shown in a provided code snippet) ([Manus tools and prompts · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jlia0/db0a9695b3ca7609c9b1a08dcbf872c9#:~:text=%5C%60%5C%60%5C%60python%20import%20sys%20sys.path.append%28%27%2Fopt%2F.manus%2F.sandbox,location)). This approach integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation: the agent actively fetches external knowledge and data instead of relying on its parametric memory. In fact, the developers confirmed Manus “supports retrieval augmented generation (RAG)”, meaning it combines external data retrieval with the model’s generation capabilities ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E7%94%A8%E6%96%BC%E9%82%8F%E8%BC%AF%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86%EF%BC%8CGPT)). All retrieved facts or data are injected into the event stream as read-only context, so that the LLM can incorporate them into its reasoning and output.

**Multi-Agent Collaboration:** A noteworthy aspect of Manus’s architecture is its **multi-agent (multi-module) design**. Rather than a single monolithic agent handling everything, Manus is structured so that specialized sub-agents or components can work in parallel on different aspects of a task ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E8%87%B3%E6%96%BCManus%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E6%BA%90%E8%87%AA%E5%85%B6%E5%A4%9A%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E6%9E%B6%E6%A7%8B%EF%BC%88multi)). For example, one sub-agent (or thread) might focus on web browsing and information gathering, while another handles coding, and another manages data analysis – each within its own isolated sandbox environment ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E8%87%B3%E6%96%BCManus%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E6%BA%90%E8%87%AA%E5%85%B6%E5%A4%9A%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E6%9E%B6%E6%A7%8B%EF%BC%88multi)) ([Manus在紅什麼？外媒評測訂餐、訂位、訂票⋯都碰壁：它是中國第二個DeepSeek時刻？](https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/manus%E5%9C%A8%E7%B4%85%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-%E5%A4%96%E5%AA%92%E8%A9%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A8%82%E9%A4%90-%E8%A8%82%E4%BD%8D-%E8%A8%82%E7%A5%A8-%E9%83%BD%E7%A2%B0%E5%A3%81-043708332.html#:~:text=%E9%80%99%E4%BA%9B%E5%AD%90%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%EF%BC%8C%E5%89%87%E5%9C%A8%E5%90%84%E8%87%AA%E7%9A%84%E8%99%9B%E6%93%AC%E6%A9%9F%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E4%B8%AD%E7%8D%A8%E7%AB%8B%E9%81%8B%E8%A1%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%88%E6%B3%A8%E6%96%BC%E7%89%B9%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99%EF%BC%8C%E4%BE%8B%E5%A6%82%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E3%80%81%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F%E6%92%B0%E5%AF%AB%E6%88%96%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E7%80%8F%E8%A6%BD%E7%AD%89%E3%80%82)). A high-level orchestrator (the main Manus brain) coordinates these, dividing the task and later integrating results. This design is inspired by distributed problem-solving: by “hiring” multiple specialist agents, Manus can tackle complex multi-faceted projects more efficiently. It also adds robustness – if one agent is busy or stuck, another can continue progress on a different subtask. Ultimately, this multi-agent architecture allows Manus to deliver **tangible outputs** that require many steps and skills. As an example, Manus can produce a complete result like a formatted
